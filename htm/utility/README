  This folder contains utilities that is not quite part of the htm algorithm
but helps during test.

image_sequence

    FORMAT:
        image_sequence <source image>
    DESC:
          Generate a list of images and the text file that contains the 
        full path of them. One image per line. The output will be
        located in ./img_seq/, and take <source image> is "~/src.bmp" 
        as an example, it will output:

            ./img_seq/list.txt
            ./img_seq/src.bmp.0.bmp
            ./img_seq/src.bmp.1.bmp
            ./img_seq/src.bmp.2.bmp
            ...

          At the present time this utility will scroll the source image
        from top to down. More function may be added later.
          It may help in testSpLearn, e.g. you may use

          $ testSpLearn < ../utility/img_seq/list.txt
          
        to input the file list into the test program.
