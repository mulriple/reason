  Programs to test if the core library is correctly working.

testSpLearn

    DISCRIPTION
        Contains one layer. Give a list of learning data and output the 
      number of quantization centers of each node.

    USAGE
        Once start, it requests input from stdin, which is a list of image
      file name seperated by newline('\n'), and for each round, output 
      plot command of gnuplot to stdout which plots the distribution of 
      the number of quantization centers of each node. 
        So you may want to use utility/image_sequence to generate a continuous
      sequence of image and then use: 

      ./testSpLearn < ../utility/img_seq/list.txt  | gnuplot

      to make a test.
